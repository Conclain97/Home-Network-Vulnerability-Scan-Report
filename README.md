# Vulnerability Scan Procedure

## Objective:
The objective of this project was to conduct a vulnerability scan on the home network using Nmap. The goal was to identify open ports, services, and operating systems on connected devices and assess their security risks.

## Tools Used:
- Nmap: A powerful open-source network scanning tool used for security auditing and discovering vulnerabilities.
  - Version: 7.95
  - Command: `nmap -sV -T4 -O -F --version-light 192.168.100.*`

## Scan Procedure:
1. Define the Scan Scope : 
   - The network IP range `192.168.100.*` was chosen to scan devices in the home network.
   
2. Run the Nmap Command :
   The following command was used to execute the scan:
   ```bash
   nmap -sV -T4 -O -F --version-light 192.168.100.*

    -sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info.
    -T4: Set aggressive timing to reduce scan time.
    -O: Enable OS detection.
    -F: Perform a fast scan (focus on fewer ports).
    --version-light: Reduce the intensity of version detection to improve speed.
3. Identify Vulnerabilities : 
- The scan results were analyzed to identify open ports, services, and operating systems on connected devices.
## Device 1: 192.168.100.1 (Huawei Home Gateway)
Open Telnet (port 23): Insecure protocol that should be disabled. Recommend switching to SSH.
## Device 2: 192.168.100.4 (Windows 10 Machine)
Open MySQL (port 3306): Exposed without authorization, which could allow unauthorized database access.
Open Microsoft Windows services (MSRPC, NetBIOS, SMB): These services can be exploited. Recommended to close unnecessary ports and enforce firewall rules.
## Device 3: 192.168.100.5
No vulnerabilities detected as all ports were closed.

4. Findings : 
-   Telnet Vulnerability: Found on device 192.168.100.1, using an insecure
      protocol that should be disabled and replaced with SSH.
    -MySQL Vulnerability: Device 192.168.100.4 exposed MySQL without authorization.
    -Windows Services: Device 192.168.100.4 had multiple open services, which are potential targets for attackers.

5. Recommendations :   
    -Disable insecure Telnet on device 192.168.100.1 and use SSH for secure access.
    -Restrict MySQL access on device 192.168.100.4 to trusted hosts and enforce authentication.
    -Close unused ports and restrict access to critical services like MSRPC and NetBIOS
